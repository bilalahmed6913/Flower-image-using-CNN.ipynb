# 🌸 Flowers Classification using CNN

This project demonstrates how to classify images of flowers into different categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal is to accurately identify the type of flower using deep learning techniques.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

- **Model**: Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Dataset**: [Flowers Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition)
- **Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Language**: Python
- **Objective**: Classify flower images into different categories such as roses, tulips, and sunflowers.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bilalahmed6913/Flowers-Classification-CNN.git
   cd Flowers-Classification-CNN
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

> **Note**: If `requirements.txt` is not available, install packages manually:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python-headless numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

### 📊 Dataset

- Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition) and extract it.
- Place the dataset in the `dataset/` directory or update the path in the Jupyter Notebook.

## 📓 Running the Notebook

1. Start the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open `Flowers image using CNN.ipynb` and run all the cells sequentially.

### 🖼️ How to Use

To classify your own flower images:
1. Place the image in the designated directory.
2. Modify the code in the **prediction section** of the notebook to specify the path to your image.
3. Run the notebook cell to get predictions on the type of flower.

## 🛠️ Model Architecture

- The CNN model was designed with multiple convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.
- **Optimizer**: Adam with a learning rate of `0.001`.
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Cross-Entropy (used for multi-class classification).
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques like rotation, zooming, and flipping were applied to reduce overfitting.

## 📈 Results

- Achieved a classification accuracy of **X%** on the validation set.
- The model performs well in distinguishing between various flower categories.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

If you encounter the error:
```
ValueError: Invalid input shape for input Tensor
```
Ensure that the input images are resized to `(150, 150, 3)` before passing them to the model. Check the image preprocessing section in the notebook for more details.
